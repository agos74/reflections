7. Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's useful to use a remote repository for open projects to share with others, perhaps allowing them to contribute to the project itself.
 
10. Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I thinks it's better to have a manual control, mainly in case of conflicts with changes to the same files.

14 Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks e clones are a copy of a remote or local repository. Branches are used to develop features that are isolated from each other. Fork is the remote copy of a repository of another user on GitHub, it's useful when we want to modify a repository of another user. Clone is a local copy of a repository, from another computer or from GitHub.   

22 Reflect: Local copies of remote branches
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The advantage is that if you go to a place where you're offline, you can sync your local copy with the remote copy before you leave, so you can work on the updated project and then when you return online you can sync it with remote copy.

25 Reflect: Collaboration using Git and GitHub
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaboration without using Git or GitHub would be more complex, it should be done with more direct communication, with a greater loss of time and with a higher chance of errors in the code, especially in case of modifications to the same files.
