7. Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's useful to use a remote repository for open projects to share with others, perhaps allowing them to contribute to the project itself.
 
10. Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I thinks it's better to have a manual control, mainly in case of conflicts with changes to the same files.

14 Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks e clones are a copy of a remote or local repository. Branches are used to develop features that are isolated from each other. Fork is the remote copy of a repository of another user on GitHub, it's useful when we want to modify a repository of another user. Clone is a local copy of a repository, from another computer or from GitHub.
